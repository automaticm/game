## Game - No Name Yet

**
Hello, if you are reading this. If you aren't, you don't get a hello from me...



## Brief Overview

As you can probably tell, I created this game using Unity. Now, I don't have a ton of experience with Unity. To be quite honest, I had none before I was presented with this opportunity. Neither do I with C#, but I could closely relate it to Java, which is why this game is somewhat functional.
