## Game - No Name Yet

**
Hello, if you are reading this. If you aren't, you don't get a hello from me...

## My Overall Goal

My overall goal is to create a game studio, like Visual Concept Entertainment Studios. Of course this is a long way to go, but hopefully I can go there step by step.

## Brief Overview

As you can probably tell, I created this game using Unity. Now, I don't have a ton of experience with Unity. To be quite honest, I had none before I was presented with this opportunity. Neither do I with C#, but I could closely relate it to Java, which is why this game is somewhat functional.

## Game Objective
// TODO
You are attending a scientific event. At that scientific event, everyone is interupted to the sound of phones ringing. Not your average ringtone, but an alarm...

## Playing the Game
// TODO
I have not tested this on any other operating systems but Windows, so you might need a Windows device to do so.
You also might need a Unity license.
